# python-challenge
 
Used python to analyze data from PyBank and PyPoll CSV files. 

Discussed code with TAs in Office Hours to count Months in PyBank file

Went over both assignments with a tutor in a tutor session, focused mainly on discussing the Average change for PyBank, and then how to export code to text file, and how to create a dictionary and went over how to add candidates from PyPoll into the list, and then how to determine how many votes per candidate.
